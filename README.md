#### 1. Concept
The Project starts from an Idea or Concept. In this Project, the concept of a tourist attraction website and a calculator were selected.

#### 2. Feasibility and Research
I discussed the feasibility of these concepts with my mentor, and he gave an okay signal for the tourist attraction website. Then I researched the requirements of a tourist attraction website and visited many websites in the same category.

#### 3. User Experience and sketch
Using the User Experience guidelines, I draw the sketches of  all pages of the website. I used Balsamiq wireframe software to draw the sketches.

#### 4. Coding
HTML5, CSS3 and javaScript are the main software used to build this project. Bootstrap 4.6 used to give a stylish and professional look to the project. Github and gitpod online platform was used to write and save the project. Gitpod's version control system was used for version control. Microsoft VS Code IDE  built-in gitpod was used for code writing.

#### 5. Testing
Two methods were adopted to test this project.  
a. Manual Testing  
b. Third-Party Test services  

##### a. Manual Testing
In this method, the website was opened in different web browsers and checked every page, link and button.
##### b. Third Party Testing services
W3C validation services were used to validate HTML and CSS files.  
Chrome Lighthouse Dev tool was used to check the website performance.  
https://responsivedesignchecker.com/ was used to check the responsiveness of the website.

#### 6. Hosting  
Github cloud hosting service used to host the website.

#### 7. Future Maintainability
